[Code under construction. Please excuse our mess as we tidy our code for a better user-friendly experience!]

## Quick-start 

The quickest way to quickly explore the notebooks found in opal/notebooks is using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). 

1. Activate your [Google Colab account](colab.research.google.com/). 

2. Download opal-star respository as a zip file and unzip it. You should now have a "opal-star" folder on your local computer. 

3. In your Google Drive, navigate to My Drive/Colab Notebooks. Upload the "opal-star" folder to this directory, such that the pathing is My Drive/Colab Notebooks/opal-star.

4. Navigate to opal-star/opal/notebooks and open the notebook you wish using Colab.

5. Append the following code block to the top of your notebook:
```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive/') # mount your google drive to access file

# change to the notebook directory
%cd '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/opal-star/'
```

6. Happy coding!
